### Useful resources

- [How to make an image have its parent card's rounded borders](https://dev.to/nicm42/card-with-an-image-and-rounded-borders-519j) - A very simple but helpful post that helped me with the image's rounded corners within a card. (I had an extremely haphazard solution to this problem on a previous project, so I'm relieved to have this much easier method.)
